## üèÜ Highlighted Metrics (Right Panel)

### **Most Consistent Ratings**

* **What it means:** This user gives steady, predictable scores without erratic shifts.
* **How it‚Äôs calculated:** We compute the **standard deviation** of the user's scores across all rated battlers.
* **Lower = more consistent**.

#### Example:

User A rates \[8, 8, 9] ‚Üí stddev = 0.47
User B rates \[1, 5, 10] ‚Üí stddev = 3.68
User A is more consistent.

### **Most Active Reviewer**

* **What it means:** The user who rated the most battlers in the last 30 days.
* **Why it matters:** Indicates recent activity and contribution volume.

### **Community Influencer**

* **What it means:** This user gives ratings that closely match the **community average**.
* **How it‚Äôs calculated:** For each rating:

  * Compute absolute difference between user's score and the average rating for that battler-attribute pair.
  * Average these differences. Lower = more influenced/aligned.

#### Example:

| Battler                                                  | User Score | Community Avg | Diff |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---- |
| A                                                        | 8          | 7.8           | 0.2  |
| B                                                        | 7          | 7.3           | 0.3  |
| C                                                        | 9          | 9.0           | 0.0  |
| Avg diff = (0.2 + 0.3 + 0.0) / 3 = 0.17 (highly aligned) |            |               |      |
